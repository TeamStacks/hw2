                  <h1>Introduction to HTML</h1>
                  <p>HTML is a <span style="color:blue">markup language</span> for describing web pages. HTML separates "content" (words, images, audio, video, and so on) from "presentation" (instructions for displaying each type of content). HTML uses a pre-defined set of elements to define content types. Elements contain one or more "tags" that contain or express content. Tags are enclosed by angle brackets, and the closing tag begins with a forward slash. </p>
                  <aside>
                     <p>The word <span style="color:blue">markup</span> was used by editors who marked up manuscripts (usually with a blue pencil) when giving instructions for revisions. "Markup" now means something slightly different: a language with specific syntax that instructs a Web browser how to display a page. </p>

                  <h1>Introduction to CSS</h1>
                  <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a <span style="color:blue">style sheet language</span> used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in a markup language. While most often used to change the style of web pages and user interfaces written in HTML and XHTML, the language can be applied to any kind of XML document, including plain XML, SVG and XUL. Along with HTML and JavaScript, CSS is a cornerstone technology used by most websites to create visually engaging webpages, user interfaces for web applications, and user interfaces for many mobile applications. </p>
                  <aside>
                     <p>A <span style="color:blue">style sheet language</span>, or style language, is a computer language that expresses the presentation of structured documents. One attractive feature of structured documents is that the content can be reused in many contexts and presented in various ways. Different style sheets can be attached to the logical structure to produce different presentations.</p>

                  <h1>History of CSS</h1>
                  <p> The first release of CSS was in 1996. This release called CSS1 was a product of the World Wide Web Consortium or the W3C. The W3C is the source for all web design schema and the standards which are used across the globe. Since the original CSS was published there have been two other schema updates provided by the Consortium. CSS2 was released in 1998 and followed by CSS3 in 1999. The schema, or plans, for CSS are divided into modules and the current version has over 40 of these units. Since the first release in 1996 CSS has become a standard for web design.</p>

                  <h1>Introduction to JavaScript</h1>
                  <p>JavaScript is a simple procedural language that is interpreted by Web browsers. JavaScript is object-based in the sense that it uses built-in and user-defined extensible objects, but there are no classes or inheritance. The code is integrated with, and embedded in, HTML. By default, JavaScript provides an object-instance hierarchy that models the browser window and some browser state information. For example, the navigator object provides information about the browser to a script, and the history object represents the browsing history in the browser window. </p>
                  <aside>
                     <p>JavaScript is classified as a prototype-based scripting language with dynamic typing and first-class functions. This mix of features makes it a multi-paradigm language, supporting <span style="color:blue">object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming</span> styles.</p>

                  <h1>History of JavaScript</h1>
                  <p>JavaScript was created in 10 days in May 1995 by Brendan Eich, then working at Netscape and now of Mozilla. JavaScript was not always known as JavaScript: the original name was Mocha, a name chosen by Marc Andreessen, founder of Netscape. In September of 1995 the name was changed to LiveScript, then in December of the same year, upon receiving a trademark license from Sun, the name JavaScript was adopted. This was somewhat of a marketing move at the time, with Java being very popular around then. </p>
